# History/Audit Tracking System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
A comprehensive history and audit tracking system has been added to the Financial Tracker application, providing complete visibility into all changes and user activities across the platform.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Backend History Models (4 new models)

#### TransactionHistory
- Tracks all transaction changes (create, update, delete)
- Stores previous and new data snapshots
- Records changed fields
- Captures IP address and user agent
- Links to user who made the change

#### AccountHistory
- Tracks account changes (create, update, delete)
- Special actions: `activated`, `deactivated`, `balance_changed`
- Balance change tracking with difference calculation
- Stores notes and audit metadata
- Links to changedBy user

#### PaymentHistory
- Tracks payment reminder changes (create, update, delete)
- Special actions: `marked_paid`, `marked_unpaid`, `rescheduled`
- Stores reason for changes
- Complete audit trail for payment lifecycle

#### UserActivityLog
- Tracks user activities: login, logout, register
- Failed login attempts for security monitoring
- Password changes and profile updates
- Plaid link/unlink events
- Data export and account deletion events
- Captures location data (country, city)
- Success/failure status with error messages

### 2. Automatic Change Tracking

#### Model Hooks
All main models (Transaction, Account, PaymentReminder) now have:
- **Post-save hooks**: Automatically log creation and updates
- **Pre-update hooks**: Capture original values before changes
- **Post-update hooks**: Record what changed with before/after snapshots
- **Pre-delete hooks**: Log deletion with final state snapshot

#### History Tracker Utility
- `trackChanges()`: Compares objects and identifies changed fields
- `createDocumentSnapshot()`: Creates data snapshots for history
- `extractRequestMetadata()`: Captures IP address and user agent

### 3. API Endpoints

#### History Routes (`/api/history/`)
- `GET /transactions` - Get transaction history with filtering
- `GET /accounts` - Get account history with filtering  
- `GET /payments` - Get payment history with filtering
- `GET /activity` - Get user activity log
- `GET /activity/stats` - Get activity statistics (30-day summary)
- `GET /all` - Get combined history from all sources

#### Query Parameters
- `limit` - Number of records per page (default: 20-50)
- `skip` - Pagination offset
- `action` - Filter by action type
- `transactionId/accountId/paymentId` - Filter by entity
- `startDate/endDate` - Date range filtering

### 4. Authentication Integration

#### Auth Controller Updates
- **Registration**: Logs new user creation with details
- **Login**: Logs successful logins with IP/user agent
- **Failed Login**: Tracks failed attempts for security monitoring
- All auth events stored in UserActivityLog

### 5. Frontend Implementation

#### History Service (`historyService.ts`)
- Type-safe interfaces for all history entry types
- API client functions for all history endpoints
- Query string builder for flexible filtering
- Error handling and response wrapping

#### History Page (`HistoryPage.tsx`)
- **Activity Timeline**: Chronological view of all activities
- **Statistics Dashboard**:
  - Total activities (last 30 days)
  - Failed login count
  - Unique action types count
- **Visual Indicators**:
  - Color-coded entries (green=create, red=delete, blue=update)
  - Action-specific icons (Plus, Trash, Edit, Check, etc.)
  - Balance change indicators with trend arrows
- **Details Display**:
  - Changed fields listing
  - Before/after data for updates
  - User who made the change
  - Timestamp and IP address
  - Balance changes with differences
- **Pagination**: Navigate through history entries
- **Dark Mode Support**: Full theming compatibility

#### Navigation Integration
- Added "History" link to sidebar navigation
- History icon (Clock/History) in nav menu
- Route added to App.tsx (`/history`)
- Mobile responsive navigation

## Data Stored in History

### For All Entities
- `timestamp`: When the change occurred
- `action`: Type of change (created, updated, deleted, etc.)
- `changedBy`: User ID who made the change
- `userId`: Owner of the entity
- `previousData`: State before change
- `newData`: State after change
- `changedFields`: Array of field names that changed
- `ipAddress`: IP address of requester
- `userAgent`: Browser/client information

### Entity-Specific Data

#### Transaction History
- Transaction ID reference
- Type, category, amount, date changes
- Merchant and tag modifications

#### Account History
- Account ID reference
- Balance changes with difference calculation
- Activation/deactivation events
- Plaid linking status changes
- Notes field for additional context

#### Payment History
- Payment ID reference
- Due date rescheduling
- Payment status (paid/unpaid) changes
- Reason for changes
- Recurring settings modifications

#### User Activity
- Action type (login, logout, register, etc.)
- Success/failure status
- Error messages for failures
- Location data (country, city)
- Security-relevant events

## Security Features

### Audit Trail
- Complete audit trail for compliance
- Track who changed what and when
- IP address logging for security
- Failed login monitoring
- Immutable history records

### Privacy Considerations
- Password changes logged but not password values
- Sensitive data excluded from history
- User-scoped access (users see only their history)
- Authentication required for all history endpoints

## Performance Optimizations

### Database Indexes
- Compound indexes on userId + timestamp
- Entity ID + timestamp indexes
- Action type indexes
- Optimized for common query patterns

### Pagination
- Configurable page sizes (default: 20-50)
- Skip/limit support
- Total count included in responses

### Efficient Queries
- Lean queries for better performance
- Populated user references only when needed
- Filtered queries to reduce data transfer

## API Response Format

### History List Response
```typescript
{
  history: HistoryEntry[],
  total: number,
  page: number,
  totalPages: number
}
```

### Activity Statistics Response
```typescript
{
  totalActivities: number,
  failedLogins: number,
  actionBreakdown: Array<{
    _id: string,           // Action name
    count: number,         // Occurrences
    lastOccurrence: Date   // Most recent
  }>,
  periodDays: number       // Time period (default: 30)
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Backend: Manual History Logging
```typescript
await logUserActivity({
  userId: user._id,
  action: 'login',
  details: 'User logged in successfully',
  req,  // Express request object
});
```

### Frontend: Fetch History
```typescript
const result = await getAllHistory({ limit: 20, skip: 0 });
if (result.success && result.data) {
  setHistory(result.data.history);
}
```

### Frontend: Get Statistics
```typescript
const result = await getUserActivityStats(30);
if (result.success && result.data) {
  console.log(`Total activities: ${result.data.totalActivities}`);
}
```
