## 🎯 File Size Targets

Before upload, verify your files meet these sizes:

| Logo File | Max Size | Typical |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| casharoo-mark.png | 50KB | 20-40KB |
| casharoo-coin.png | 50KB | 20-40KB |
| casharoo-wordmark.png | 80KB | 30-60KB |
| casharoo-full-logo.png | 100KB | 40-80KB |
| casharoo-favicon.png | 10KB | 5-8KB |

**Total for all 5 logos**: Aim for <250KB (excellent), <500KB (acceptable)

## 💡 Design Tips

### For casharoo-mark.png (Main Icon)
- Keep it simple - should work at 64×64px
- High contrast for visibility
- Test on dark backgrounds
- Kangaroo silhouette + coin element

### For casharoo-coin.png (Circular)
- Centered design with 10% padding
- Works great for loading spinners
- Consider gold/amber color for "coin" feel

### For casharoo-wordmark.png (Text Logo)
- Horizontal layout
- "Casha" in emerald, "roo" in darker shade
- Clean, readable font
- May include small kangaroo icon

### For casharoo-full-logo.png (Hero Logo)
- Mark on left, wordmark on right
- Your "official" logo for big moments
- Use on landing pages, press kits

### For casharoo-favicon.png (Tiny Icon)
- **Most important**: Simplify heavily!
- Bold shapes only (no fine details)
- Must be recognizable at 16×16px
- Test at actual size before exporting

## 🐛 Common Issues

### "Logo not appearing"
1. Check file name spelling (case-sensitive!)
2. File must be in `public/logos/` not `src/logos/`
3. Hard refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R)
4. Check browser console (F12) for 404 errors

### "Logo looks blurry"
1. Export at 2× or 3× resolution
2. Use PNG-24 format (not PNG-8 or JPEG)
3. Don't scale up in browser (export larger)

### "File size too large"
1. Compress at https://tinypng.com
2. Reduce dimensions (512px → 384px)
3. Simplify design (fewer colors/gradients)
4. Consider WebP format (see optimization guide)

### "Logo doesn't work on dark mode"
1. Must use transparent background (not white!)
2. Test on black background in design tool
3. Consider adding subtle glow/outline for dark mode

## 📊 Performance Impact

### Current Setup (Placeholders)
- 5 files × 67 bytes = **335 bytes total** 🚀
- Load time: Instant

### After Real Logos (Optimized)
- 5 files × 50KB average = **250KB total** 🚀
- Load time on 4G: <500ms
- Still excellent performance!

### If Not Optimized (Don't do this!)
- 5 files × 400KB average = **2MB total** ❌
- Load time on 4G: ~3 seconds
- Bad user experience!

## ✨ What Makes This Setup Great

1. **Lazy Loading**: Logos only load when visible (saves bandwidth)
2. **Flexible**: Easy to swap PNG files without touching code
3. **Performance**: Optimized workflow ensures fast loading
4. **Dark Mode**: Transparent backgrounds work everywhere
5. **Retina-Ready**: Export at 2× for crisp display
6. **Future-Proof**: Can add WebP versions later for even better compression

## 🎉 You're All Set!

The system is ready for your logos. Follow the 3-step process in `LOGO_QUICK_START.md` and you'll have your custom branding live in minutes!
