## 📄 Pages Updated

### 1. AccountsPage (2 toast points)
**Success Toasts:**
- ✅ "Account created successfully!" - After creating new account
- ✅ "Account deleted successfully" - After deleting account

**Error Toasts:**
- ❌ Shows specific error message for failed creation
- ❌ Shows specific error message for failed deletion

**Code Pattern:**
```tsx
const result = await AccountService.createAccount(accountData);
if (result.success) {
  toast.success('Account created successfully!');
  await loadAccounts();
  setIsAddModalOpen(false);
} else {
  const errorMsg = result.error || 'Failed to create account';
  setError(errorMsg);
  toast.error(errorMsg);
}
```

---

### 2. TransactionsPage (1 toast point)
**Success Toasts:**
- ✅ "Transaction created successfully!" - After creating transaction

**Error Toasts:**

## 🔧 Developer Notes

### Import Pattern
```tsx
import toast from 'react-hot-toast';
```

### Usage Pattern
```tsx
// Success
toast.success('Action completed!');

// Error
toast.error('Something went wrong');

// With variable message
const errorMsg = result.error || 'Default message';
toast.error(errorMsg);
```

### Why This Pattern?
1. **Consistent UX:** All operations provide feedback
2. **Error Visibility:** Errors shown in both toast AND error state
3. **User Confidence:** Immediate confirmation of actions
4. **Non-intrusive:** Toasts auto-dismiss, don't block UI
5. **Mobile Friendly:** Works well on small screens

## 📈 User Experience Improvements

### Before (Without Toasts)
- User creates account → Modal closes → Must look for account in list
- User deletes account → Account disappears → No confirmation shown
- User logs in → Redirects to dashboard → No welcome message
- User creates transaction → Modal closes → Must check if it worked
- Errors only shown in error text below forms

### After (With Toasts)
- ✅ Instant success confirmation for all actions
- ✅ Clear error messages that stand out
- ✅ Welcoming messages for login/registration
- ✅ No need to verify action success manually
- ✅ Errors visible even if user scrolls away from form
