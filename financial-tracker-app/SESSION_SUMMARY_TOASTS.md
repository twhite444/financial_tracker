## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Pattern Used
```tsx
// Import
import toast from 'react-hot-toast';

// Success case
const result = await Service.operation(data);
if (result.success) {
  toast.success('Operation successful!');
  await reload();
  closeModal();
} else {
  const errorMsg = result.error || 'Operation failed';
  setError(errorMsg);
  toast.error(errorMsg);
}
```

### Why This Pattern?
1. **Dual feedback:** Error state + toast for visibility
2. **Consistent UX:** Same pattern across all pages
3. **User confidence:** Immediate visual confirmation
4. **Non-blocking:** Toasts auto-dismiss
5. **Accessible:** Screen reader compatible

---

## 🎨 Design Choices

### Toast Styling
```tsx
{
  duration: 3000,
  style: {
    background: '#363636',
    color: '#fff',
  },
  success: {
    iconTheme: { primary: '#10b981', secondary: '#fff' }
  },
  error: {
    iconTheme: { primary: '#ef4444', secondary: '#fff' }
  }
}
```

### Rationale
- **Dark background:** Matches app's glassmorphism theme
- **Top-right position:** Standard UX pattern, doesn't block content
- **3-4 second duration:** Enough time to read, not too long
- **Green/Red icons:** Universal success/error indicators
- **Auto-dismiss:** No user action required

---

## 🧪 Testing Performed

### Manual Verification
✅ All pages compile without errors  
✅ No TypeScript warnings for toast usage  
✅ Import statements correct  
✅ Toast positions verified in code  
✅ Duration settings confirmed  
✅ Color theme validated

### What to Test Next (User Testing)
- [ ] Create account and verify green toast appears
- [ ] Delete account and verify success toast
- [ ] Create transaction and check toast
- [ ] Mark payment as paid and verify toast
- [ ] Try invalid login and check error toast
- [ ] Register new account and see welcome toast
- [ ] Verify toasts don't block UI interactions
- [ ] Check toasts on mobile viewport
