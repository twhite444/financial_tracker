### 6. **Typography**
- **Headings**: Always white/black for maximum contrast

- **Links**: Clear blue with hover states in both modes

### 7. **Mobile-Specific Enhancements**
- All touch targets meet Apple/Google guidelines (48x48px)
- Responsive spacing at multiple breakpoints (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`)
- Bottom navigation doesn't overlap content
- Header doesn't crowd on small screens
- Proper z-index layering (sidebar: 40, header: 50, FAB: 50)

## üìè Responsive Breakpoints Used
- **Mobile**: `< 640px` - Smallest spacing, largest touch targets
- **Small (sm)**: `640px+` - Slightly more spacing
- **Medium (md)**: `768px+` - Desktop-like spacing begins
- **Large (lg)**: `1024px+` - Full desktop layout with sidebar

## üé® Color System
### Light Mode
- Background: `blue-50`, `purple-50`, `pink-50` gradient
- Cards: `white/80` with `gray-200` borders
- Text: `gray-900` headings, `gray-700` body
- Primary: `blue-600` ‚Üí `blue-700` hover

### Dark Mode
- Background: `gray-950`, `gray-900` gradient
- Cards: `gray-800/90` with `gray-700` borders
- Text: `white` headings, `gray-300` body

## üîç Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test on iPhone SE (smallest modern phone)
- [ ] Test on iPad (tablet view)
- [ ] Test on desktop (1920x1080)
- [ ] Test on ultra-wide (2560x1440)
- [ ] Verify all touch targets are accessible
- [ ] Check keyboard navigation works
- [ ] Verify color contrast in both modes
- [ ] Test with screen reader (VoiceOver/NVDA)
- [ ] Verify no horizontal scroll at any breakpoint
- [ ] Check FAB doesn't overlap bottom nav on mobile

## üöÄ Performance Considerations
- All transitions use `duration-200` or `duration-300` for snappy feel
- Backdrop blur effects are optimized
- No layout shifts during theme transitions
- Smooth scroll behavior enabled
- Custom scrollbars don't impact layout

## üéØ Next Steps for Even More Robustness
1. Add `prefers-reduced-motion` media query support
2. Implement `focus-visible` for better keyboard navigation UX
3. Add loading states for all async operations
4. Implement skeleton screens for all data loading
5. Add proper error boundaries
6. Implement proper form validation UI
7. Add toast notifications for better feedback
