## 🔢 Calculation Examples

### Monthly Payment (30-year mortgage)
```typescript
Principal: $200,000
Interest:  5% (0.05)
Term:      360 months (30 years)
Result:    $1,073.64/month
```

### Amortization Schedule
```
Payment 1:  $833.33 interest + $240.31 principal = $1,073.64
Payment 2:  $832.33 interest + $241.31 principal = $1,073.64
...
Payment 360: $4.44 interest + $1,069.19 principal = $1,073.64
```

### Total Interest
```
Total Paid:     $386,511.57
Principal:      $200,000.00
Total Interest: $186,511.57

## 💡 Technical Decisions

### Why Amortization Calculations in Frontend Model?
- **Performance**: No API call needed for quick calculations
- **Offline**: Works without backend connection
- **Flexibility**: Can be used in multiple components
- **Validation**: Preview calculations before submitting

### Why Separate Service Layer?
- **Separation of concerns**: UI doesn't know about fetch
- **Reusability**: Service can be used across components
- **Testability**: Easy to mock in tests
- **Error handling**: Centralized error responses

### Why MongoDB Virtuals?
- **Performance**: Calculated fields don't need storage
- **Consistency**: Always computed from current state
- **Cleaner API**: Response includes computed fields

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations (To Address)

1. **Loan Details Modal**: Currently placeholder (implementing next)
2. **Payment History**: Not yet integrated with transactions
3. **Charts**: No amortization visualization yet
4. **Export**: No PDF/CSV export yet
5. **Currency**: USD only (multi-currency coming)
6. **Timezone**: Dates use local timezone (should use UTC)
