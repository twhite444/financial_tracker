## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies (already done!)
npm install --ignore-scripts

# Setup Husky manually (since .git is in parent dir)
# Skip for now or move git to app directory

# Run tests
npm run test:unit           # Unit tests
npm run test:integration    # Integration tests
npm run test:e2e            # E2E tests
npm run test:all            # All tests

# Code quality
npm run lint                # Check code quality
npm run lint:fix            # Fix linting issues
npm run format              # Format code
npm run type-check          # TypeScript checking

# Development
npm run dev                 # Start dev server
npm run test:watch          # Watch mode for tests
```

## 📊 Test Coverage Requirements

Your financial tracker has strict coverage requirements:

| Metric     | Threshold | Why? |
|------------|-----------|------|
| Lines      | 80%       | Ensure most code is tested |
| Functions  | 80%       | All functions should work correctly |
| Branches   | 75%       | Cover different logic paths |
| Statements | 80%       | Verify all operations |

## 📝 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions:

1. **Review Test Files**
   ```bash
   # Check the sample tests
   cat tests/unit/services/AccountService.test.ts
   cat tests/e2e/critical-flows.e2e.ts
   ```

2. **Run Your First Test**
   ```bash
   npm run test:unit
   ```

3. **Setup Databases** (for integration tests)
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name mongo-test mongo:7
   docker run -d -p 6379:6379 --name redis-test redis:7-alpine
   ```

4. **Install Playwright Browsers**
   ```bash
   npx playwright install
   ```

### For Production:

1. **Setup GitHub Repository**
   - Push code to GitHub
   - Configure branch protection rules
   - Add GitHub Secrets for CI/CD

2. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Fill in real database URLs
   - Add JWT and encryption keys

3. **Enable CI/CD**
   - GitHub Actions will run automatically
   - Monitor test results in Actions tab

4. **Setup Code Coverage**
   - Sign up for Codecov
   - Add `CODECOV_TOKEN` to GitHub Secrets

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Write Tests First (TDD)**
   - Define expected behavior in tests
   - Implement functionality to pass tests
   - Refactor with confidence

2. **Use Test Factories**
   ```typescript
   import { factories } from '@tests/helpers/factories';
   const user = factories.user();
   const account = factories.schwabChecking(user.id);
   ```

3. **Tag E2E Tests**
   ```typescript
   test('critical flow @smoke @auth', async ({ page }) => {
     // Test implementation
   });
   ```

4. **Debug with Playwright UI**
   ```bash
   npm run test:e2e:ui
   ```

5. **Monitor Coverage Trends**
   - Check coverage reports after each test run
   - Aim to increase coverage over time

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **Husky Setup**
   - Currently skipped due to Git location
   - Either move `.git` to app directory or configure Husky with custom directory

2. **npm audit vulnerabilities**
   - 7 vulnerabilities detected (non-critical)
   - Review with `npm audit`
   - Update dependencies as needed

3. **TypeScript Errors in Config Files**
   - Expected until packages are used
   - Will resolve when running tests
